The programs access your webcam and detect the face and it gives the gender and the age category on the screen itself and the program is quitted when "q" on keyboard centered
# Age and Gender Identifier

Welcome to the Age and Gender Identifier project! This application utilizes computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time through a webcam feed and estimates the age group and gender of individuals. It provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface powered by Tkinter, making it accessible for users of all levels.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam feed.
- Estimation of age group (Child, Young Adult, Adult, Elderly) and gender (Male, Female) of detected faces.
- User-friendly graphical interface with a single button to start the face detection process.
- 
## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
